# B.Sc.-Software-Project

Contains the final report of my B.Sc. Software Engineering course. The title of this project is "Automobile Maintenance and Breakdown Assistance".

In our Software Engineering (Sessional) course, CSE-434, it is required to develop a software project following prescribed software engineering principles and framework.  Our project entitled Automobile Maintenance and Breakdown Assistance was developed to provide a one stop service in case ofemergency roadside vehicle breakdown especially in remote locations.

This work was supervised by [Mir Md. Saki Kowsar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mir-Kowsar) and [Ashim Dey](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashim-Dey-2).
